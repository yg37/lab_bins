Bins.java
Readability:
•	No comments in the main program, so the reader has a hard time figuring out the logic of the program. 

Testability:
•	Main method too long – 
o	Write a new method that takes an array list of integers as input(i.e. output from readData method) and outputs disks that are created. In this way, each piece/method can be tested more easily by just calling the method instead of making changes to the main method every single time
o	Maybe create a new class for the implementation of each algorithm instead of mixing it together
•	Too many print statements in the main method makes debugging extremely difficulty


Extensibility:
•	Lack of instance variables – makes extending the class hard
o	Can make results an instance variable so that it can accommodate potential read ins without erasing existing data
o	  
Disk.java
Readability:
•	Line 98 – confusing that the return result contains ID 
Extensibility:
•	Should set mySize to be a constant – avoid duplicate codes

Refactors:
Bins:
•	Create an instance variable results
•	Create a new method getData to get results
•	Create two classes for each of the two algorithsm
